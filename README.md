Dia 3 commit:

One of the most important days, I have implemented the "safe password" system using dictionary.

I reformulated the interface and improved its logic, making future portability easier.

The logical system for creating a secure password uses a dictionary, reducing the use of IF and ELSE.

That's all, In dia 4 commit I will try to create new window, and try to make one of the micro-projects
